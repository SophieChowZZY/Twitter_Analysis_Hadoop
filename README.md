# Twitter_Analysis_Hadoop
## For CS4480 Group Project
This repo stores the code for doing the Twitter Sentiment Analysis on Hadoop and Pig Latin. Also the fetch tweet using Twitter Developer Account and snscrape on Python. These files are created and updated by me. <br>
The Data file contains raw data; Dictionaries contains three dictionaries. <br>
The sentiment folder contains mapreduce java file for doing all steps, which names "tweet_analysis.java. <br>
Despite that, the seperate java files outside any folders are mapreduce for each seperate job as I first tried to seperate the process into different files. <br>

### Discussion on using Hadoop<br>
Since our data is not very big in size, the MapReduce overheads can significantly latent the performance. Also since no one in the group knows java including me, it spends me a lot of effort on doing the java programming. Given the performance of Hadoop, it may not be worthwhile on doing that. <br> 
Moreover, another future development could be using OpenMP which I am interested to learn and adopt. <br>

### End
It is happy to learn a lot of things within one semester of time. Although I was surprised that in the end all these parallel computing fancy jargons may not beat the very beginning C++ in performance, it was a pleasant journey to known the development of the technology.
